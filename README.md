# yagwr - Yet Another Gitlab Webhooks Runner


## Inspiration/Acknowledgments, isn't there enough of these projects already?

That's a fair question. Before I decided to write my own project, I look for
projects that solved my project. And while I found quite a few there, they were
either to simple of to complex for me needs. One project that got
almost perfectly right for my needs, is [gitlab-webhook-receiver][gitlab-webhook-receiver].
I took inspiration on this project specially `config.yaml` file, so thank you
for the idea, I will be using a similar approach here.

**NOTE**: I started the project a few days ago, so in the next couple of days,
you'll still won't find anything useful in this repository. Because I need that
for a few projects I'm working on, I'm confident that in the next couple of
weeks, I'll have a working first version.
