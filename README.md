# yagwr - Yet Another Gitlab Webhooks Runner


## Inspiration/Acknowledgments, isn't there enough of these projects already?

That's a fair question. Before I decided to write my own project, I looked for
projects that would fit my needs. And while I found quite a few out there, they were
either to simple or to complex for my needs. One project in particular that got
almost right for my needs is [gitlab-webhook-receiver][gitlab-webhook-receiver].
However I had a few issues with it when I tested it, so I decided to write my
own. I took inspiration on this project, specially the `config.yaml` file, so thank you
for the idea, I will be using a similar approach here.

**NOTE**: I started this project a few days ago, so in the next couple of days,
you'll still won't find anything useful in this repository. Because I need this
for a few other projects, I'm confident that in the next couple of
weeks, I'll have a working first version.
